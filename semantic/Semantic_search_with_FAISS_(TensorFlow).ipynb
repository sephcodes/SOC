Set up, tear-down, operate amusement food concessions.\\nThe OFLC ETA requested detail on specific portions of these job duties.  \\nFood Concessions set up & tear down:  Mobile food concessions are typically mounted in a trailer.  A supervisor would position the trailer(s) at a specific location on the grounds, unhitch the power unit from the trailer.  The awnings covering the windows during transit would be raised & secured.  Items such as trash cans, screens, tables that may be positioned outside of the trailer but carried inside of the trailer during transit would be manually moved from inside the trailer to outside.  Trailer would be cleaned, sanitized & stocked with supplies for the event.  Any counters, guidance railings, signage, decorations would be positioned outside of the trailer. Condiment dispensers, napkin dispensers & trash containers would be set up outside of the trailer. Typically the fair or event maintains the tables & chairs for patrons, but is some instances the worker may set up a limited number of chairs & tables for patron use.  Teardown would simply be these duties being handled in the reverse order & items being stored & secured for transit to the next location.\\nTo clarify the portion of the job duties that includes operate mobile food concessions stand:   On a carnival midway, when there is a mobile food concessions, a stand is limited to selling only one or two specific items, such as cotton candy, popcorn, turkey legs, roasted corn, or other specialty foods.  The food is prepared in a production line, where an individual may only perform one task, such as measuring corn & oil into a popper.  The next individual would salt & bag.  The next individual would choose correct bag as per customer order & hand to teller.  The next individual would have taken order, taken money, made change & then hands order to client.\"\n",

Set up, tear-down, operate amusement rides, food concessions, game concessions and/or novelty concessions.\\n\\nThe OFLC ETA requested detail on specific portions of these job duties.  \\n\\nAmusement Rides set up & tear down:  Mobile amusement rides are trailer mounted.  A supervisor would position the trailer(s) at a specific location on the grounds, unhitch the power unit from the trailer, & move the power unit away from the ride.  All of the pieces of the ride would travel on the same trailer(s) & be located proximate to their position when the ride is in operation.   Work would be performed by individual workers as members of a team, with some tasks being performed individually & some collectively.  Restraints holding pieces of the ride while in transit would be released.  Ride platform (if any) would be lowered & leveled.  Track or railing (if any) would be positioned & connected.  Sweeps, supports, bars, pins would be positioned & connected.  Cars, Seats, Bench or Carriage (method of conveyance for this particular ride) where patron would stand or sit while on the ride would be positioned & connected.  Fencing, signage, ticket collection boxes & illumination would be positioned.  Teardown would simply be these duties being handled in the reverse order & items being stored & secured for transit to the next location.  May include moving/positioning, maintenance, repairs and refurbishment of equipment.\\n\\nFood Concessions set up & tear down:  Mobile food concessions are typically mounted in a trailer.  A supervisor would position the trailer(s) at a specific location on the grounds, unhitch the power unit from the trailer.  The awnings covering the windows during transit would be raised & secured.  Items such as trash cans, screens, tables that may be positioned outside of the trailer but carried inside of the trailer during transit would be manually moved from inside the trailer to outside.  Trailer would be cleaned, sanitized & stocked with supplies for the event.  Any counters, guidance railings, signage, decorations would be positioned outside of the trailer. Condiment dispensers, napkin dispensers & trash containers would be set up outside of the trailer. Typically the fair or event maintains the tables & chairs for patrons, but is some instances the worker may set up a limited number of chairs & tables for patron use.  Teardown would simply be these duties being handled in the reverse order & items being stored & secured for transit to the next location.\\n\\nGame Concessions:  Mobile game concessions are typically mounted in a trailer.  A supervisor would position the trailer(s) at a specific location on the grounds, unhitch the power unit from the trailer, & move the power unit away from the game concessions trailer.  The awning that is closed during transit would be opened.  Gaming items (air guns, water guns, darts, etc., as appropriate for the game) would be positioned.  Plush toys and/or game appropriate prizes would be positioned / displayed. Signage, illumination, seating (if any), railings (if any), fencing (if any) would be positioned.  Teardown would simply be these duties being handled in the reverse order & items being stored & secured for transit to the next location.\\n\\nTo clarify the portion of the job duties that includes operate mobile food concessions stand:   On a carnival midway, when there is a mobile food concessions, a stand is limited to selling only one or two specific items, such as cotton candy, popcorn, turkey legs, roasted corn, or other specialty foods.  The food is prepared in a production line, where an individual may only perform one task, such as measuring corn & oil into a popper.  The next individual would salt & bag.  The next individual would choose correct bag as per customer order & hand to teller.  The next individual would have taken order, taken money, made change & then hands order to client.',\n",
